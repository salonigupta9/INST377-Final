https://salonigupta9.github.io/INST377-Final/ Farmers Markets in PG County. This is meant to be run on Google Chrome (ver 113.0.5672.92). The API for this project was https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/sphi-rwax.json which provided information on farmers markets in PG county and their locations. The API was fetched in the javascript file of the project. I used the leaflet library to display a map that showed all the locations of farmers markets in the county. I did not use any CSS frameworks, just a stylesheet that was provided in the labs done for the class. The project is trying to display farmers markets in different areas of the county in order to help people find one closest to them and their city. Many people miss out on the opportunity of shopping organic and fresh because they are not aware of the markets in their area.
